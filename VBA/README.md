During my internship in JA solar, 
I was task to make data processing easier from data of IVOC test.
The machine output its data from the test into an excel file.
Therefore excel VBA was used to make accessible for workers with no experience with programming
I did not learn excel VBA before my internship and need to learn the language while also peforming routine checks
The macro have two main parts: Making the table and Making the graphs
